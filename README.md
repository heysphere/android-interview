# Recruitment of the Sphere Android team

Thank you for choosing to apply to Sphere for our Android job opening.

## The process

1. The hiring manager will first have a conversation with you. If both sides are happy to proceed, we will enter the Demo Project stage.

2. The Demo Project stage includes three paths. Choose the one path which you think you will do best in:

   * [The Babylon Health Android tech test](https://github.com/babylonhealth/android-playbook/blob/master/recruitment/code_challenge.md)
   * A previous tech demo project which you have already put hard work in
   * An open source project which you have substantially contributed to

   We will review your submission and then decide whether or not we should proceed to a face-to-face (F2F) interview stage.

3. The F2F interview stage will involve non-technical sessions with our senior staff, and also a technical session with the iOS team.

   The technical session will last for 90-120 minutes. We will start with a pairing session revolving around your project submission, that might involve (but not limited to) refactoring for improvement, improving test coverage, and conversations about design choices you have made.
   
   After that, we will move onto a general conversation around techincal knowledge you have in the aforementioned areas. You may refer to the Babylon Health Android [UI interview questison](https://github.com/babylonhealth/android-playbook/blob/master/recruitment/design_questions.md) & [Architecture Interview Questions](https://github.com/babylonhealth/android-playbook/blob/master/recruitment/architecture_questions.md) for a rough idea of what questions you can expect.
